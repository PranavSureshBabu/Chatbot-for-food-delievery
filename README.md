INTRODUCTION
I developed a chatbot named Alexa for a food delivery restaurant to streamline customer interactions. I built this chatbot using Dialogflow, designing multiple intents such as new order, order add, order remove, and track order to handle different customer requests. Each intent was trained with various phrases to understand user inputs accurately. I also created custom responses to provide instant replies to users. For backend processing, I used Python to manage logic and interactions. Additionally, I integrated a SQL database using SQL Workbench to store and retrieve order details. The chatbot ensures smooth communication between customers and the restaurant. It efficiently processes orders, modifications, and tracking requests
